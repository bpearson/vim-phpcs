 VIM - PHP_CodeSniffer Plugin
--------------------------------

Introduction
---------------------------------
vim-phpcs is a small plugin that will run PHP_CodeSniffer on the current file, and run the results in a vim window.

Requirements
---------------------------------
To use this plugin, you need:
- Vim
- PHP_CodeSniffer 1.3+ (earlier versions may work but that depends on the return format of the code sniffer report).

Installation of plugin.
---------------------------------
1. Obtain a copy of this plugin and place phpcs.vim in your Vim plugin
   directory and vim-phpcs.txt in the docs/ directory.
2. Add "let Vimphpcs_Standard='STANDARDNAME'" to your .vimrc file.
   (where STANDARDNAME is the name/path of the standard)
3. Restart Vim.
4. You can now use the ":CodeSniff" command to run PHP_CodeSniffer
   and display the results.

Usage.
--------------------------------
To use this plugin on the current file, simply type:
:CodeSniff          (which shows both errors and warnings)
:CodeSniffErrorOnly (which only shows errors)

Version history
--------------------------------
0.1 - First release
0.2 - Added a check for the code sniffer binary and the standard as a config option (so you do not have to modify the plugin).
